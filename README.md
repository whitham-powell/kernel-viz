# kernel-viz
This project implements a framework for visualizing kernels via a kernelized perceptron for STAT 671: Statistical Learning I at Portland State University. Future extensions may include visualizing other RKHS-based methods like kernel PCA and SVMs to explore kernelized learning techniques.
